# Conversely-Kunal

## Overview

This project is a simple React application that demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a 3x3 matrix grid. The application includes the following features:

1. Interactive 3x3 Grid: A 3x3 matrix of clickable boxes is displayed. Each box starts with a white background.
2. Color Change on Click: When a box is clicked, its color changes to green.
   Sequence-Based Color Transition: Once all boxes have been clicked, each box's color transitions to orange in the order of their clicks, creating a visual sequence.
3. Reset Functionality: A reset button is provided to clear the grid and reset the colors of all boxes to their initial white state.
4. Heading: The application includes a centered heading titled "Kunal Chhatwani Assignment" for easy identification.

The project serves as an excellent example of handling state and event-driven updates in a React application. It showcases fundamental React concepts such as state management with hooks (useState), event handling, conditional rendering, and dynamic style updates.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. These are essential for running the project and its development server.

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It's used to run the development server and build scripts.
- **npm**: A package manager for JavaScript, used to install dependencies.

You can download and install Node.js (which includes npm) from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

Inside the project directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

    ```sh

    ```

3. **Run Development Server**

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will start a local development server and open the application in your default web browser. You can now view and interact with the application locally.

4. **Now open the localhost link provided in the terminal in the browser**

   ```sh
         VITE v5.3.4  ready in 302 ms
